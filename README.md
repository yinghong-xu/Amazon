Scrape Amazon Product Data Python

Check out "Web Scraping Amazon.ipynb" You will find more code in there.

Basically what I did was to scraped product data from multiple pages on Amazon Best Sellers utilizing Python for word tokenization. 

I built regression models to analyze product ranking factors and created a list of word frequency. 

Finally I visualized the output to find trending products and provide sentiment analysis for the company.

You can utilize my code to create a table from any department you want from Amazon Best Sellers.
